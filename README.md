- The data is cleaned and organized to facilitate analysis.
- Interactive charts are generated using Streamlit and Plotly for visualization.
- The user can filter the anime by year, season, genre, rating, and studio to customize the analysis.
- Various metrics are calculated to answer the questions, such as average ratings by genre and the relationship between number of episodes and ratings, among others.
